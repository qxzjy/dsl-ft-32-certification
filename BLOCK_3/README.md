## Description

[ECB](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/cardfraud/html/ecb.cardfraudreport202110~cac4c418e8.en.html) is a European institution that defines the broad monetary policy guidelines for the euro area.

In the EU in 2019, the European Central Bank estimated that fraudulent credit card transactions amounted more ‚Ç¨1 billion! üòÆ

AI can really help solve this issue by detecting fraudulent payments in a very precise manner. This usecase is actually now one of the most famous one among Data Scientists.

However, eventhough we managed to build powerful algorithms, the hard thing is now to use them in production. This means predict fraudulent payment in real-time and respond appropriately.
